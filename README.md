###ETH Dero Bridge Frontend

## how to use

clone the repo using git clone
move into project folder and open terminal and type code . 
or open with VSstudio 
ensure liveserver is installed on Visual studio
hard code the token address into the bridge.js file line 1 const derobridge address and save
open live server on index.html
once you have launched all contracts on the dero bridge smart contract repo supplied by Ternton, you should be supplied with a token address, the token address is the address you use for the input field ERC20 on the API front end
to use the front end sign into metamask, then click "connect metamask" button
scroll down the page and click drop down menus to show details
on ERC20 form input the token address given when you launched the DeroBridge Repo from trenton on testnet
this ties this front end the DeroSmart contracts together 


This frontend has been built using simple HTML, JS, CSS and some bootstrap styling
to use the functions of the front end, ie to connect meta mask,
hardcode the dero bridge address into bridge.js line 1 const bridgeAddress = "";
